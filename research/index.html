                I designed, fabricated, and characterized a superconducting transmon qubit module for integration 
                with a quantum optomechanical transducer to realize a ‘node’ in a quantum network capable of emitting optical photons, 
                which are entangled with superconducting qubits inside the node. To ensure efficient capture of microwave photons 
                emitted by the transducer, I optimized the circuit geometry based on a prototype module to achieve better photon absorption efficiency. 
                I also implemented asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to improve 
                quantum coherence of the qubits. 
                This qubit module can be implemented in a future quantum network distributing 
                entanglement across remote superconducting processors.

        <h3>
            Realizing Photonic Integrated Circuits on Thin Film Lithium Niobate
        </h3>
            <p>

                Integrated photonics based on thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) has been a promising all-optical
                solution for low-cost and energy-efficient communication, sensing, and computing. Due to its strong non-
                linearity, TFLN has emerged as a promising foundation for modern systems including photonic computing.
                However, all computers require a combination of linear and nonlinear operations. While these elements have
                been demonstrated individually on TFLN, they have yet to be combined on the same chip to implement a
                full computer. To do so requires further optimization of both components to make them compatible with
                each other. One vital component of the circuits is optical couplers. This project optimized several types of
                couplers and performed fabrication sensitivity tests on them. These were done by using commercial software,
                and then the results were verified by using different simulation methods, including FDE, EME, and FDTD.
                The real devices were then fabricated, and the results were measured.
