            I develop the fabrication process for high-quality <strong>Josephson junctions (JJs)</strong> based on the
            PICT method for improved device coherence. I also design and fabricate an electromagnetic implementation of
            a <strong>cat qubit</strong>, which is a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to its
            inherent error bias and potential for hardware-efficient quantum error correction. This device will serve as
            a first step toward realizing a hybrid cat qubit incorporating a mechanical quantum memory.

            I lead the design and fabrication of <strong>on-chip coupled optical parametric oscillators (OPOs)</strong>
            to demonstrate spectral phase transitions and to serve as a foundation for developing an on-chip optical
            Ising machine. I characterized the fabricated devices and tested for <strong>quasi-phase matching
                (QPM)</strong> through <strong>optical parametric generation (OPG)</strong>.

        <h3>Development of a Qubit Module for Realizing Networks of Superconducting Quantum
            Processors
        </h3>

            I designed, fabricated, and characterized a <strong>superconducting transmon qubit module</strong> for
            integration
            with a <strong>quantum optomechanical transducer</strong> to realize a ‘node’ in a <strong>quantum
                network</strong> capable of emitting optical photons,
            which are entangled with superconducting qubits inside the node. To ensure efficient capture of microwave
            photons
            emitted by the transducer, I optimized the circuit geometry, using <strong>Sonnet</strong>, based on a
            prototype module to achieve better photon absorption efficiency.
            I also implemented asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to improve
            quantum coherence of the qubits.
            This qubit module can be implemented in a future quantum network distributing
            entanglement across remote superconducting processors.

        <h3>
            Realizing Photonic Integrated Circuits on Thin Film Lithium Niobate
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Prof. Alireza Marandi, California Institute of Technology (January 2023 - December 2023)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I worked on integrated photonics using thin-film lithium niobate <strong>(TFLN)</strong>,
            a promising platform for low-cost, energy-efficient communication, sensing, and computing.
            Thanks to its strong nonlinearity, TFLN is emerging as a leading candidate for photonic computing.
            However, building a full optical computer requires integrating both linear and nonlinear elements
            on the same chip—something that has not yet been fully achieved. My goal was to help bridge this
            gap by optimizing a key component: optical couplers. I designed and tested several types of couplers
            using commercial electromagnetic simulation tools, <strong>Lumerical</strong>, and verified the results
            through multiple simulation methods, including FDE, EME, and FDTD.
            I then fabricated the devices and characterized their performance to
            evaluate their robustness and fabrication sensitivity.
